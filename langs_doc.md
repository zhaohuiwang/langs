## LangChain, LangGraph and LangSmith
* LangChain provides a comprehensive set of components and abstractions (like chains, agents, memory, prompts, LLMs) for building various LLM applications (Chaining Large Language Models).
* LangGraph is built on top of LangChain and extends its capabilities, particularly for handling complex, stateful, and multi-agent workflows.
* LangSmith is a platform for building production-grade LLM applications. It allows you to closely monitor and evaluate your application, so you can ship quickly and with confidence. <br>
In essence, LangChain provides the building blocks, LangGraph enables complex orchestration, and LangSmith ensures the resulting application runs efficiently and reliably.
